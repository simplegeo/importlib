Description: Backport of importlib.import_module() from Python 2.7
 This package contains the code from importlib as found in Python
 2.7. It is provided so that people who wish to use
 importlib.import_module() with a version of Python prior to 2.7 or in
 3.0 have the function readily available. The code in no way deviates
 from what can be found in the 2.7 trunk.
